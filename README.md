# Easy Cooking Desing

## Introduction

This is a small and very simple project I'm working on to go deeper in CSS concepts and understanding.

The idea is to merge my passion for cooking and development to build a functional, beautiful and user-friendly design.

This project is a mock design for a cooking course website, with plans to subscribe to get access to recipes, videos of how to cook, images of dishes and a list of ingredients used in the recipes.

## Primary goal

The goal of this project in particular is to deepen my knowledge of plain CSS.

## Goal behind the Primary Goal

For a while now, I wanted to create a portfolio to show my abilities in frontend development. This project is the first of many I intend to create to show my work.

## Home Page

The home page is the introduction to the page, where we can find a call to action on eating heathier and making our own meals. It shows the three plans the user can have access to with a simple description.

At the end of the page, we have a section with the key features of the cooking course.

### Modal

Every time any of the CHOOSE PLAN button is clicked, we show a modal with a confirmation button to redirect to another page (yet to be created).

## Packages page

The Packages page is where the packages are more detailed.

## Customer page

The Customer page is where we can show our customers reviews.

## Start Cooking Page

The Start Cooking page contains a form where new clients can sign up to have access to the recipes. The submit buttom does not do anything for now.


## Common components

Every page has a Nav bar with a hamburguer button with a side menu when the user uses small devices and a top menu with bigger devices.

Every page also has the same footer with two links to Support and Terms of Use, which are not ready yet.


### Reactive buttons and styling

The buttons change color when hover and change the shadow to create an impression that they are being pushed down. They also change width according to the page's width.

Some features, like the list of plans and the list of key features in the home page are shown in a line when the page is large enough and in a column when the page get narrowed.

The same thing happens with the Customers Page: When the page is large enought the customer image and their review is side-by-side, but when the space is smaller, the two components are aligned vertically.

## What's next?

### Add missing pages

#### Support Page

The idea is to create a fake support page, with some FAQs, a form for the user to get in touch, some contact information, etc.

#### Terms of Use Page

The idea is to create the simplest page possible with some terms of use.
